            <p>
                An essential benefit of extracurriculars is developing a sense of community that is rooted in
                their
                shared values and contributions
                to civic responsibilities. A sense of community means people bear the sense of purpose and
                belonging,
                effective social interaction
                and social opportunity in their communities. Having a sense of community can be a huge benefit
                for
                students in order to establish their
                identity and their own sense of community through extracurriculars in their own way.

            <h2>Ways To Build Sense Of Community</h2>
            <p>
                One of the easiest ways for students to build their own sense of community or to feel that they
                are
                a part
                of a community of belonging is
                getting involved with different organizations with goals that students align with. A community
                is
                built with
                mutual interdependence, trust,
                and shared values and goals. With these main elements, students can strive to learn more about
                themselves
                while doing work for the community.
                Personal indentity and the sense of being a part of something big can be a huge intrinsic
                development for
                students.

            <h2>Effective Social Interaction</h2>
            <p>
                Students can develop new social skills and opportunities through extracurriculars including
                self-awareness, engagement, teamwork, and collaboration.
                Student's tends to be happier as a result of having access to a social network. Good social contact
                can
                help
                communities address challenges by fostering relationships and bonds as well as expanding these
                networks.
                Having social opportunities to meet new
                people and making new friends are a huge benefit for students because humans are a social race.
                Making
                friends can help prevent the feelings of
                isolation and help create a sense of belonging. Quality of life tends to be better with friends
                since
                companionship can provide a deeper level of
                support regarding health challenges such as depression and loneliness. Students will have the
                ability to
                meet a whole bunch of different individuals
                and have the opportunity to make friends in their lives.
