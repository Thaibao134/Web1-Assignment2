                <h2>Sense of Community and Belonging</h2>        
                    <p> 
                        An essential benefit of extracurriculars is developing a sense of community that is rooted in their shared values and contributions 
                        to civic responsibilities. A sense of community means people bear the sense of purpose and belonging, effective social interaction 
                        and social opportunity in their communities. Having a sense of community can be a huge benefit for students in order to establish their
                        identity and their own sense of community through extracurriculars in their own way. There has been many studies that shows having a sense 
                        of belonging can enhance social engagement and participation within communities. By being involved and having a sense of community,
                        it can make students feel as though they are a part of something bigger while making a difference. The sense of achievement by completing
                        something big that requires skills and efforts which involves a large portion of individuals can be incredibly rewarding. 
                    </p>
                        One of the easiest ways for students to build their own sense of community or to feel that they are a part of a community of belonging is 
                        getting involved with different organizations with goals that students align with. A community is built with mutual interdependence, trust, 
                        and shared values and goals. With these main elements, students can strive to learn more about themselves while doing work for the community.
                        Personal indentity and the sense of being a part of something big can be a huge intrinsic development for students.

                <h2>Effective Social Interaction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Students can develop new social skills and opportunities through extracurriculars including self-awareness, engagement, teamwork, and collaboration. 
                        Student's tends to be happier as a result of having access to a social network. Good social contact can help 
                        communities address challenges by fostering relationships and bonds as well as expanding these networks. Having social opportunities to meet new 
                        people and making new friends are a huge benefit for students because humans are a social race. Making friends can help prevent the feelings of
                        isolation and help create a sense of belonging. Quality of life tends to be better with friends since companionship can provide a deeper level of 
                        support regarding health challenges such as depression and loneliness. Students will have the ability to meet a whole bunch of different individuals
                        and have the opportunity to make friends in their lives.
