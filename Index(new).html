                            Playing sports teaches kids life qualities such as teamwork, leadership, accountability, patience, and self-confidence while also preparing them to tackle life problems.
                            Students have the opportunity to improve their physical and mental talents in order to attain their life objectives. We can see the value of sports in our everyday lives through a range 
                            of national and international sporting events held all around the world in which different athletes represent their nations and demonstrate their athletic ability.
                            Furthermore, a student's learning begins at the elementary level, and sports assist students to create a solid mental and physical foundation from an early age.
                            The following are some of the reasons why, in addition to academic growth, sports and games are important in a student's life.
